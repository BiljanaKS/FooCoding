3.1 First, declare your variable x (do not initialize it yet).
3.2 Add a console.log statement that explains in words what you think the value of x is, like in this example:

// TODO -> here you initialize your variable

3.3 Add a console.log statement that logs the value of x.
3.4 Now initialize your variable x with an integer.

// TODO -> log the actual value of x
// TODO -> here you initialize your variable

4.2 Now console.log the variable y.
4.3 Now assign a new string to the variable y.
4.4 Just like what you did before write a console.log statement that explains in words what you think will be logged to the console.
4.5 Now console.log y again.

6.3 console.log your array.
6.4 Create an array that has your favorite animals inside (see if you can find a good name that exactly describes what this variable will hold).

/*8. Write a program that checks the types of two variables and prints out SAME TYPE if they are the same type.
8.1 First declare at least four variables and assign them different data types.
8.2 For each variable write a console.log statement that logs the value

let foo = 3;
console.log("The value of my variable foo is: " + foo);
(Curious to know what a foo is? Check this article on Wikipedia.)

8.3 Now write a console.log statement wherein you first explain in words what you think the type of your variables is.
8.4 Now use typeof to log the actual type of your variables.
8.5 Now compare the types of your different variables with one another.
8.6 Make sure to also show a message when the variables you are comparing are not the same type.

For example:

let x = 9;
let y = 'Hello';

if (...) {
    console.log('SAME TYPE');
